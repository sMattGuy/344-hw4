Now we are engaged in a great civil war, 
testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and dedicated, 
can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. 
We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting 
place for those who here gave their lives that that nation 
might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
